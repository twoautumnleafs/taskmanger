Task Tracker in C# using OOP + SOLID
Recently developed a lightweight task tracker as a project to practice clean architecture in C#. It supports:
 ✅ Users & categories
 ✅ One-time and recurring tasks (via polymorphism)
 ✅ Clean class design with encapsulation & inheritance
 ✅ Fully follows SRP, OCP, LSP from SOLID principles
